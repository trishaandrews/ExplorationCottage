## Philosophy 


<img style="float: right; max-width: 50%; padding: 20px;" src="../img/profile.JPG" title="My picture">  


I always strive to create a sense of magic in my classrooms as well as in my personal life. I believe children should be surrounded by wonder and possibilities that may seem outside the realm of reality. My goal is to create an environment where children can imagine something seemingly impossible, believe that they can make it possible, and then make it a reality.  

With a background in ECE and kindergarten, I have seen the benefits of sensory play firsthand. Whether it’s a group of kiddos standing around a large sensory table filled with rice and shells or just one child exploring a small kit, they are learning as they play. They are expanding their vocabulary, building their imaginations, developing their fine motor muscles and honing their problem-solving skills. They’re making connections with the materials and categorizing them as rough, smooth, tiny or large. Children also become more mindful during sensory play which helps them regulate their emotions.

Many preschools have adopted learning through play theories that encourage children to explore their world through play. Sensory play especially has become a staple in many quality preschools because studies show that children really do make more meaningful connections by using all their senses and exploring in open-ended environments.

I want to support the brave parent-teachers by creating sensory kits that mimic the large table format in the classroom but in a smaller, home-manageable version. The kits I’ve created contain a wide variety of stimulating sensory elements that allow for the broadest range of exploration and will encourage kiddos to return to their kits again and again.

When parents play alongside their kiddos, they become part of the experience, learning and even part of the kit. Allow your child to explore the kit freely with no expectations, rules, or guidance. But yes, please do engage with your child and the kit.


## Experience

I have always loved art and grew up playing teacher every chance I got. I knew that I would become an art teacher someday. But then life shows you things that you were not aware of and sets you on a different path. I put myself through school by teaching in a preschool in Milford, New Hampshire. I came to believe so strongly in the benefits of quality Early Childhood Education that I received my Associate degree in ECE. I continued on in my education at Franklin Pierce University toward my goal of becoming an art teacher and received my Bachelor’s degree in Art Education. I began teaching art in public schools and I enjoyed it but always seemed to be drawn back to my core in the field of ECE. It was definitely more fulfilling to observe the magic of developmental growth and to know that I had a hand in guiding and nurturing that growth.

2020 changed a lot of people’s perceptions of what life, career and education could look like. After more than 5 years in a preschool classroom where I had been teaching pre-k kiddos I transitioned to a family environment teaching just one extraordinary child. Many preschools closed or reduced their enrollment. I learned that many parents were homeschooling their kids and struggling to keep them engaged while still learning. My advice when asked what I believed would work to keep kiddos engaged while still learning was play; specifically, sensory play.
