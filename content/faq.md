## Are there instructions?

Being an open-ended experience, there is no right or wrong way to play. These kits
contain loose parts that are meant to be combined, disassembled and re-combined
in multiple ways so however your kiddo chooses to explore the materials is up to
them.

## How many pieces come in each kit?

Each kit has a different number of materials or loose parts in it. The average
number of pieces in each kit is approximately 40.

## Is the playdough, kinetic sand, and slime allergen free?

All the fun, gooey, sticky materials in each kit are free from allergens.

## Should I play with my child?

It’s always a good idea to play alongside your kiddo. Using guiding words and actions
are excellent ways to gently lead your child’s experience and help expand their
vocabulary.

## Is there a wrong way to use this kit?  

As there are no rules, there is no wrong way to use these kits. Whatever
combination of materials your kiddo wants to create is the right way to play.

## What age children are these kits meant for?

All kits contain small, loose parts which may be considered choking hazards for
children under the age of 3 years old. These kits are meant to be explored by
children over the age of 3. Adult supervision is always the best choice when playing
with small parts.
