text: "I’ve been an educator for over 30 years; from pre-k to 6 th grade to volunteering at daycares as their
“science nana.” My grandkids love these sensory kits. We pulled out a sensory kit on a snow day and my
girls (3 &amp; 8 years old) played non-stop for hours without any input from me. Months later, they are still
playing with the kit. I love sitting close by to see and hear their imagination and creativity soar. I highly
recommend these sensory kits."
